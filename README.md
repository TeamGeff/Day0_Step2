### Instructions for Git and getting stuff to GitHub
First step was getting git installed in the terminal. This was done by typing 
  git --version
and having tools download automatically.
Then, we created a folder, initialised a project using:
  git init
and then proceeded to copy the files into the project directory. Then, having all the files in the right folder, we added them, then commit in two parts.
  git add *.c
  git commit -m "Commit text"
After all changes were committed, we pushed tho the master branch of the remote repository
  git push -u origin master
  
Thus, we had the files online, and in the same project. (We made the README.md file, online (: 
)
